# Welcome to the Georgian/English PDF Vocabulary Learner

Visit [https://gujejiani.github.io/English-Learner/](https://gujejiani.github.io/English-Learner/) to view the application in your browser.

## Introduction
Sometimes it's inconvenient to learn words from a vocabulary list because you have to hide half of it to test your knowledge. This application makes the learning process easier by allowing you to simply upload vocabulary from a PDF.


## Preview after Processing
After processing, you can see the page with the vocabulary displayed.
